/* 1. useState is a React Hook that allows functional components to have state. In this code, useState is used to initialize a state variable named values and a function setValues to update that state variable.

2. The values state variable is an object with two properties: email and password, both initially set to empty strings.

3. The handleInput function is a callback function intended to handle changes in form inputs. It's typically used as an onChange handler for form inputs. This function takes an event object as its parameter, which contains information about the input that triggered the event.

4. Inside the handleInput function, setValues is called with a callback function. This callback function takes the previous state (prev) and returns a new state object. The spread operator (...) is used to create a shallow copy of the previous state object, and then the value of the input field that triggered the event (event.target.value) is assigned to the corresponding property in the state object using computed property names ([event.target.name]).

5. [event.target.name] is a dynamic key in the object literal syntax. It allows us to use the value of event.target.name (which corresponds to the name attribute of the input element) as the key for the property being updated in the state object.

6. handleSubmit is a function that prevents the default behavior of form submission. In this case, it's used to prevent the form from being submitted to the server and causing a page refresh. */

{errors.email && <span className="text-danger">{errors.email}</span>}

/* 
1. In React, {} is used for embedding expressions within JSX, which allows for dynamic rendering of content based on certain conditions or states. Let's break down the code:

2. errors.email: This is presumably a variable holding error messages related to the email input field. If there's an error associated with the email field, errors.email will contain a non-empty string, otherwise, it will be undefined or a falsy value.

3. &&: In JavaScript, the logical AND operator (&&) evaluates to the value of its second operand if the first operand is truthy; otherwise, it returns the value of the first operand. This operator is often used for conditional rendering in React components.

4. <span className="text-danger">{errors.email}</span>: This JSX code will be rendered only if errors.email is truthy. It will render a <span> element with a CSS class text-danger, commonly used for displaying error messages in red or indicating that there's an error. The content of the <span> will be the error message contained in errors.email.

5. So, the significance of {errors.email && <span className="text-danger">{errors.email}</span>} is that it conditionally renders an error message based on whether there's an error associated with the email input field. If there's an error, it renders the error message within a <span> element with a red color (indicated by the text-danger class). Otherwise, if there's no error, nothing will be rendered. This approach is commonly used to provide visual feedback to users about the validity of their input fields in forms, helping to improve the user experience by indicating where corrections are needed.
